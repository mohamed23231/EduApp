# BRANCH PROTECTION SETTINGS FOR MAIN BRANCH
# ============================================================================
#
# This CODEOWNERS file enforces mandatory code review for auth-critical files.
# The following branch protection rules MUST be configured in GitHub:
#
# Settings → Branches → main → Branch protection rules:
#
# 1. ✅ Require a pull request before merging
#    - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
#    - Require review from code owners (enabled below)
#
# 2. ✅ Require approvals: minimum 1
#    - At least one approved review required before merge
#
# 3. ✅ Require review from Code Owners
#    - Automatically request review from @privat-edu/auth-leads for auth files
#
# 4. ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
#    - type-check (from .github/workflows/type-check.yml)
#    - test (from .github/workflows/test.yml)
#    - lint (from .github/workflows/lint-ts.yml)
#
# 5. ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
#    - Ensures PR is rebased on latest main before merge

# AUTH BASELINE FREEZE — REQUIRES TECH LEAD REVIEW
# ============================================================================
#
# The following files are frozen behind mandatory code owner review.
# Any changes to these files require approval from @privat-edu/auth-leads.
#
# Frozen scope:
#   - src/features/auth/** — Auth feature modules
#   - src/modules/auth/** — Auth business logic and services
#   - src/modules/onboarding/** — Onboarding flow and state
#   - src/lib/api/client.tsx — API client with token refresh interceptor
#
# Rationale: These files form the authentication baseline that must remain
# stable to prevent regressions in login, signup, token refresh, and routing.
#
# Replace @privat-edu/auth-leads with your actual GitHub team or user handles.
